## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas and Python will be used cleaning and preprocessing the data, as well as any other analysis needed.

### Database Storage
PostGres SQL is the database we will be using for this project.

### Machine Learning
We will be using the SciKitLearn library for our machine learning model, and we intend to use a Balanced Random Forest Classifier to reduce overfitting but keep our accuracy high.

### Dashboard
When it is time for the presentation, we will be using Tableau to showcase our findings.
