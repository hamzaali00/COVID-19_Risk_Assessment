# Capstone_Project Presentation
The topic of our project is COVID-19. While observing COVID-19 mortality rates we will be taking a deeper dive as to the causes of these deaths (age, co-morbidities,etc.) and the conditions that may have contributed to those deaths. We will also be looking at how the deaths are distributed across different age groups.

There are several reasons we selected this topic. Wide base of knowledge in COVID-19 data, broad perspectives, dynamic, varying yet reliable, plethora of data soruces.

Our data comes from the Center for Disease Control, at data.cdc.gov, where many different datasets covering a variety of topics is available. Our dataset contains 14 columns and 472,000 rows. 

The primary question we are looking to answer with this dataset is: 
#### How did various health conditions contribute to COVID-19 Deaths?
#### How did age contribute to COVID-19 Deaths?
#### How did location contribute to COVID-19 Deaths?
####Did age or underlying health conditions have a bigger impact on COVID-19 outcomes?
#### Compare and contrast conditions with higher incidence of death vs. conditions with lower incidence of death####?
#### What is death rate per 100,000?
#### How does this data tie into predictive analytics and why is this critical in fighting COVID-19? 
Irrespective of the variations in available data, stakeholders (policy makers) have to make critical decisions resulting in meaningful implications for both COVID-19 transmission and mortality. These analytics can be a game changer in predictive models evaluating a plethora of “what if” scenarios to guide decision-making.
