# Capstone_Project Presentation
The topic of our project is COVID-19. We will be looking at COVID-19 deaths, and the conditions that may have contributed to those deaths. We will also be looking at how the deaths are distributed across different age groups.

There are two primary reasons we selected this topic. The first reason is that it is topical, and will remain topical in the coming years. The second reason is that we were certain there would be plenty of data from credible sources to choose from.

Our data comes from the Center for Disease Control, at data.cdc.gov, where many different datasets covering a variety of topics is available. Our dataset contains 14 columns and 472,000 rows. 

The primary question we are looking to answer with this dataset is: How are the number of COVID-19 deaths affected by various health conditions?

We are also looking to answer the question: How does age group impact the number of COVID-19 deaths when various health conditions are a factor?
